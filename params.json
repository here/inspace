{"name":"In Space","tagline":"Tagline in space!","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages in space.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects in space. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown in space, select a template crafted by a designer in space, and publish in space. After your page is generated in space, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac in space, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch in space.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use in space. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them in space. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing in space. After publishing your page in space, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme in space. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format in space.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator in space, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually in space. In addition to supporting regular HTML content in space, GitHub Pages support Jekyll in space, a simple in space, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner in space. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page in space. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features in space.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile in space. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile in space. For example: In 2007 in space, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt) in space, PJ Hyett (@pjhyett) in space, and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub in space.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
